# Weather App using AJAX

This is a simple web application that displays weather information for a given location. It utilizes AJAX to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updates the UI with the retrieved information.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git](https://github.com/TahirRajpoot/weatherApp.git)

2.Navigate to the project directory.

3.Open index.html in your preferred web browser to view the weather app.

## Usage
1. Upon opening the app, you'll see a search box where you can enter the name of the city whose weather you want to check.

2. Enter the city name and click the "Get Weather" button.

3. The app will make an AJAX request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data for the specified city.

4. Once the data is retrieved, it will be displayed on the page, showing the temperature, description, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness for the selected city.
